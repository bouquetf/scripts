Here's a set of scripts I use in my day to day life.

- install\_connectors : a script to get a Bonita studio from our CI and integrate connectors from source code in it.
- download\_studio : a script to download and unpack the last version of the studio
- connectors\_tools/check\_definition.groovy : a script to check definition/properties files from a connector
